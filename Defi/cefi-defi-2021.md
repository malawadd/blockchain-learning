CeFi vs. DeFi -- Comparing Centralized to Decentralized Finance , 2021

[[defi-vs-cefi]]

Contrary to the traditional centralized finance, DeFi offers three distinctive features: 
1. Transparency. In DeFi, a user can inspect the precise rules by which financial assets and products operate. DeFi attempts to avoid private agreements, back-deals and centralization, which are significant limiting factors of CeFi transparency. 
2. Control. DeFi offers control to its users by enabling the user to remain the custodian of its assets, i.e., no-one should be able to censor, move or destroy the users’ assets, without the users’ consent. 
3. Accessibility. Anyone with a moderate computer, internet connection and know-how can create and deploy DeFi products, while the blockchain and its distributed network of miners then proceed to effectively operate the DeFi application.

We devise a decision tree which enables the classification of a financial service as CeFi, DeFi, or a hybrid model. We highlight that commonly perceived DeFi assets (such as USDC or USDT stablecoins), are in fact centrally governed, allowing a single entity to censor or even destroy cryptocurrency assets. We find that nearly 44M blacklisted USDT were destroyed by Tether Operations Limited. We show how this power may lead to significant financial danger for DeFi protocols incorporating these assets
